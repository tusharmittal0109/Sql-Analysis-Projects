# 📊 Instagram Reach Analysis

## 🌟 Overview
This project analyzes Instagram reach and engagement using Python. The dataset includes various Instagram metrics, and we use data visualization and machine learning to gain insights and predict future engagement trends.

## 🚀 Features
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handles missing values and ensures data consistency.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uses Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for visual insights.
- ☁️ **Word Cloud Generation**: Analyzes text data to find commonly used words.
- 🤖 **Predictive Modeling**: Uses the PassiveAggressiveRegressor for engagement prediction.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 🏗️ **Pandas & NumPy**
- 📉 **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- 📊 **Plotly**
- ☁️ **WordCloud**
- 🤖 **Scikit-Learn**

## 📜 Mathematical Formulation

The prediction model is based on Passive Aggressive Regressor:

```html
<p style="text-align:center; font-size: 20px;">
\[
\hat{y} = wX + b
\]
</p>
```

where:

- &#x20;is the predicted engagement
- &#x20;is the weight vector
- &#x20;is the input feature matrix
- &#x20;is the bias term

```
```
